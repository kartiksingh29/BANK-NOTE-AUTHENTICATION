# BANK-NOTE-AUTHENTICATION

In this project we are dealing with the data which was extracted from images that were taken for the evaluation of an authentication procedure for banknotes. Here we will use machine learning models to design a model which will function for authentication of banknotes.
We will plot HeatPlot , Distribution Plots as Data Pre-processing in order to find out outliers and null values. Then post pre-processing ,we will use two Supervised Learning Classification Model , Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines. For both the models, we will calculate the accuracy and  support designed models with Classification Report and Confusion Matrix and compare them.
